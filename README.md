# DataQuest Project Repository

This is my repository of personal data science projects that I created through either curated learning platforms or from personal curiosity. 

The projects are in the form of jupyter notebooks and showcase my learning progress and skills.  

## Projects:

### 1. Google/Apple App Store Project: 
  - Purpose: Compare data between the Google Play and Apple App stores to make a recommendation regarding the best genre in which to create a new 'free' app.
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python
  - Notebook: [App Store Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/Free_App_Data_Project.ipynb)
### 2. Hacker News Post Analysis: 
  - Purpose: Analyze source data to determine when the best time to make a post is to capture the most comments.
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Hacker News Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/hacker_news_proj.ipynb)
### 3. Used Automobile Data Analysis:
  - Purpose: Explote data from German eBay auto site and determine which vehicle brands were most popular and which sold for the highest price. 
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Used Automobile Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/autos_proj.ipynb)
### 4. Interstate 94 Traffic Volume Analysis: 
  - Purpose: Determine what the greatest contributor to traffic volume is on the I-94 westbound lanes in St. Paul, MN, and make a recommendation on when the best travel times are. 
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Interstate Traffic Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/interstate_data_project.ipynb)
